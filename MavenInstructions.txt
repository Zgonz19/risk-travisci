1. Install maven 
	https://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/
2. pull the latest build from the 'Gonzalo' branch on github.

3. go to the root directory of the project (the 'risk-project' folder)
	- use 'mvn -v' or 'mvn --version' in cmd to verify maven was succesfully installed
	- you may have to set the corrects path variables for the java JRE/JDK if this or something else in the instructions doesn't work
	- googling any errors that arise will show you what to do in more detail 

4. compile, build, and run the project from the root directory (a 'target' folder will be created in the root of the project)
	mvn compile
	mvn package
	java -cp target/risk-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Risk

5. project must be recompiled and packaged after every new change or update that we make. first use:
	mvn clean
	- this will delete the 'target' folder and all of its files (this is a necessary step).
	- repeat step 4 to compile, package, and run the updated version of the porject.



risk-project\src\main\java\ARG should only contain the .java project files

risk-project\src\test\java\ARG should only contain the .java test case files

everything else goes in the project root directory (the 'risk-project' folder)

Don't ask me why. All I know is that I was able to get the project to run via this method. 
We should be able to continue development as long as we preserve this structure. 
We should also be able to continue using git with the branch I made.
